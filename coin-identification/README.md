**Coin Identification**

This program idenfies a coin type in an image with respect to a set of provided reference coins (in the coins/ folder).

To compile and run:

- mkdir coin-identification/bin
- cd  coin-identification/bin
- cmake ..
- make
- ./homework hw02 ../test_images/test11.png ../coins/
It prints out the letter identifying the coin.
